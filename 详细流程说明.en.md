# Only 30 lines of code, using Generator to elegantly solve request contention in Vue, React

# What are the common competing issues in front-end

In Vue, React, we often encounter this problem: in a page, the rapid execution of the same operation, such as page flipping, search box, will trigger a number of request operations, due to network problems, or data query fast or slow different. Due to network problems, or different speeds of data query, the request sent later may be returned first. First sent after the return, resulting in the rendering of the previous data. This is a common front-end race problem.
However, we only need the result of the last request, the previous requests can be ignored.


# Previous solutions
The following are some of the common solutions:

## 1. determine if the operation is interrupted before assigning a value to data by using variable markers

```javascript
watchEffect((onCleanup) => {
  let isCancel = false

  fetchSomething().then(res => {
    if (isCancel) return
    renderData.value = res
  })

  onCleanup(() => {
    // Execute the cleanup function the next time watch is executed
    isCancel = true
  })
})
```

## 2. Utilize `about()`, interrupt request in cleanup function

This is a much better solution, as it saves the user bandwidth and traffic by interrupting the request directly, using the fetch api as an example

```javascript
watchEffect((onCleanup) => {
  const ac = new AbortController();

  const res = fetch('url', {
    signal: ac.signal
  }).then(res => {
    renderData.value = res
  })

  onCleanup(() => {
    // The next time watch is executed, execute the cleanup function
    ac.abort()
  })
})
```

## 3. Using RxJS

```js
const target = useRef(null); // point to the search button

useEffect(() => {
  if (target) {
    const subscription = fromEvent(target.current, 'click') // Observable click event flow
      .pipe(
        debounceTime(300), // defibrillate the event stream
        switchMap(cur => // Switch the event stream to a request stream and stop observing old requests when a new one starts generating data.
          from( // promise --> Observable
            postData(
              'url', 
              {
                name: keyword
              }
            ),
          ),
        ),
        map(cur => cur?.data?.name),
        tap(result => { // handle side effects
          setData(result);
        })
      )
      .subscribe(); // trigger
    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }
}, [target, keyword]);
```

## 4. You can also use redux-saga in react.

The takeLatest, cancel, etc. methods of redux-saga can be used to solve the race problem easily.
See the official website for more details: https://redux-saga.js.org/

```js
import { take, put, call, fork, cancel, canceled, delay } from 'redux-saga/effects'
import { someApi, actions } from 'somewhere'

function* bgSync() {
  while (true) {
    while (true) {
      yield put(actions.requestStart())
      const result = yield call(someApi)
      yield put(actions.requestSuccess(result))
      yield delay(5000)
    }
  } finally {
    if (yield cancelled())
      yield put(actions.requestFailure('Sync cancelled!'))
  }
}

function* main() {
  while ( yield take(START_BACKGROUND_SYNC) ) {
    // Start the background task
    const bgSyncTask = yield fork(bgSync)

    // Wait for the user to stop
    yield take(STOP_BACKGROUND_SYNC)
    // The user clicks stop, canceling the background task
    // This will cause the forked bgSync task to jump into its finally block.
    yield cancel(bgSyncTask)
  }
}
```

## Some shortcomings of the above scenarios

In option 1, 2. It is easier to implement. But it requires us to declare our own variables for control, which doesn't have a good logical cohesion. If our watch function is requesting from 2 interfaces serially, we have to declare a variable for each interface to control it if we want to realize precise control. This would result in less readable code.

Program 3, 4. Can solve the more complex problem of request concurrency. But there are drawbacks:

  1. These 2 frameworks require some getting started time. If the project itself is relatively simple. Only a few common need to control competing requests. Then the introduction of these two frameworks will also lead to an increase in the complexity of the project. The build cost will also increase a bit. Other students in the project will also need to learn to use the frameworks. If it is changed in an existing old project, then the cost of change will also be larger.
  2. redux-saga is not suitable for use in vue.
  3. and not so good to use `about()` to interrupt the request and save user's traffic bandwidth.

# Utilizing the Generator iterator to achieve a more elegant solution

### First let's take a look at the basic usage of Generator
```javascript
// Declare an iterator function
function* helloWorldGenerator(args1) {
  const res1 = yield args1; console.log(res1)
  console.log(res1)
  return 'ending';
}
// Execute the iterator function, which will return an iterator
const hw = helloWorldGenerator('hello'); // Execute the next() function, which will return an iterator.
// Execute the next() function, which causes the code inside the iterator function to execute until it encounters the yield keyword.
// The yield keyword is a special case, and it's necessary to split this line of code into two parts.
// The code to the left of yield, which we'll call the left value first.
// The code to the right of yield is called the right value.
// When the next function is executed, the result of the current right value is returned in value. That's the value of args1, 'hello'.
const { value } = hw.next() // { value: 'hello', done: false }
// If we don't do next again, the program gets stuck. It won't assign a value to res1.
// If we go on to next, and add the argument. If we continue to execute next, with arguments, then we execute the assignment statement for the left value of yield, which is the argument to next, not the right value of yield. The content of the assignment is the argument to next, not the content of the right value of yield.
hw.next(value + ' next')
// console.log('hello next')
// { value: 'ending', done: true }
```

This article is about solving such problems using generator. There is no need to introduce additional frameworks. There are no external variables to control. The overall difference is minimal compared to previous code written in the async/await style.

Let's start by simulating a slightly more complex scenario
The user clicks a button and modifies a variable. Then, based on this variable, two interfaces are serially requested. Each interface returns and immediately renders to the page.

### Code without processing

First of all how we do not do the race processing, the main code is as follows:

```javascript


const currentIndex = ref();
const firstData = ref();
const secondData = ref();
const queryList = [
  {
    time: 1,
    data: 1,
  },
  {
    time: 2,
    data: 2,
  },
];

// Listen for changes to the variables and send requests
watch(
  () => currentIndex.value,
  (val, oldVal, onCleanup) => {
    fetchAndSetData(val)
  }
);

// Send 2 requests with separate settings
async function fetchAndSetData(val) {
  const args = queryList[val]
  beforeData.value = await fetchDelayTime({ data: args.data + 'b', time: args.time / 2 })
  resData.value = await fetchDelayTime(args);
  return res
}

// Encapsulate the interface that simulates the request. data is returned as is in the request's return data. time is the delay time of the request.
async function fetchDelayTime({ data, time }) {
  let res = await fetch(`/api/delayTime?data=${data}&time=${time * 1000}`, {
    cache: "no-store",
  })
  res = await res.json()
  return res.data
}

```

The template code looks like this:

```html
<template>
  <div>currentIndex: {{ currentIndex }}</div>
  <button
    class="btn"
    v-for="(item, index) in queryList"
    :key="index"
    @click="() => {currentIndex = index}">
    time: {{ item.time }} data: {{ item.data }}
  </button>
  <div>firstData: {{ firstData }}</div>
  <div>secondData: {{ secondData }}</div>
</template>
```

## Stage 1: Simple transformation with generator

Here we have 2 main phases. The first stage implements the logic similar to option 1. The second phase is to implement the logic similar to that of scenario 2.

In the first phase, a simple version will be implemented. Our goal is to complete the judgment logic similar to that of scenario 1, that is, to make a judgment after getting the data.  If it is canceled, then no subsequent assignments will be made.
We know that the main role of the generator is to pause the function execution process, and then externally through the next () method to control the function execution. We can use this feature to achieve our goal.

#### 1. Here first modify the `fetchAndSetData` function to the following form:

```js
function * fetchAndSetData(val) {
  const args = queryList[val]
  beforeData.value = yield fetchDelayTime({ data: args.data + 'b', time: args.time / 2 })
  resData.value = yield fetchDelayTime(args);
  return res
}
```

`await` does work well, but it automatically waits for the Promise behind it to finish executing, and then the program automatically performs the subsequent assignment operation. There's no way to intervene externally, unless you get an error that stops the function.
Instead of await, we use yield.
This allows us to do it manually, making a judgment call after the data has been fetched. If it is canceled, then no subsequent assignments will be made.

#### 2. Next modify the watch callback function as follows:

```js
// Listen for changes to variables and send requests
watch(
  () => currentIndex.value,
  async (val, oldVal, onCleanup) => {
    // Generate an iterator
    const fetchIterator = fetchAndSetData(val)
    // cancel the subsequent operation or not
    let isCancel = false
    // The result of the last yield, which needs to be passed in on the next next.
    let lastNext
    // Cleanup function
    onCleanup(() => {
      isCancel = true
    })
    // Loop over the iterator and determine if it needs to be canceled.
    while(true) {
      if (isCancel) {
        // Canceling interrupts the subsequent operations of the iterator, which is done here with return() and can be interrupted with throw(). 
        // But later we need to unify the handling of "cancel errors" inside the controller and let the business function handle other regular errors like network 500, syntax errors
        // And if the logic internally if to catch the asynchronous function separately, so that throw() can't interrupt all the operations after the function!
        fetchIterator.return('cancel')
      }
      const { value, done } = fetchIterator.next(lastNext)
      // If the right value of the field is a Promise, wait for the Promise to finish executing and pass the result to the next next.
      // Here, await waits for the Promise, in the program that controls the generator, instead of directly in the generator. We'll explain why later.
      try{
        if (value instanceof Promise) {
          // Waiting outside for the Promise to finish executing may return a reject error, such as a network 500 error, which should be handed off to the business iterator and handled by a catch in the business code.
          lastNext = await value
        } else {
          lastNext = value
        }
      } catch (err) {
        fetchIterator.throw(err)
      }
      if (done) break
    }
  }
);

```

This completes our main function. As you can see, with multiple serial requests. We are still able to interrupt the last callback function normally.

#### 3. Optimize and encapsulate

Of course, we still have a lot of variables written in the watch. In order to make it easier to use them in other places, we'll do a bit of wrapping.

```js

watch(
  () => currentIndex.value,
  vueWatchCallbackWarp(fetchAndSetData)
)
// Wraps a function to control the execution of the generator, which will be used elsewhere.
// fetchGenerator is a generator function, . . args is the argument to the generator function, which is also the argument to the watch callback function.
// We'll execute fetchGenerator in the generatorCtrl function
async function generatorCtrl(fetchGenerator, ...args) {
  const fetchIterator = fetchGenerator(...args)
  let isCancel = false
  let lastNext
  function cancel() {
    isCancel = true
  }
  // Execute the fetchGenerator inner function code.
  async function doFetch() {
    while(true) {
      if (isCancel) {
        fetchIterator.return('cancel')
      }
      const { value, done } = fetchIterator.next(lastNext)
      try{
        if (value instanceof Promise) {
          lastNext = await value
        } else {
          lastNext = value
        }
      } catch (err) {
        if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
          fetchIterator.return('cancel')
        } else {
          fetchIterator.throw(err)
        }
      }
      if (done) break
    }
    return lastNext
  }
  return {
    doFetch
    cancel
  }
}

// The watch function, the code that performs the callback and cleanup operations. Let's do a wrapping as well
function vueWatchCallbackWarp(fetchGenerator) {
  return (val, oldVal, onCleanup) => {
    const { cancel, doFetch } = generatorCtrl(fetchGenerator, val)
    onCleanup(cancel)
    doFetch()
  }
}

```

#### 4. For requests made directly after a button click, the last request also needs to be canceled

Of course, we don't just use the watch case in our code. For requests made directly after clicking a button. We also need to deal with this kind of contention in the case of successive requests.
In that case, we need to save the `cancel()` function. When the user clicks the button, the `cancel()` action of the previous function is performed. This will interrupt the last request.
Add the code as follows.

```js
const clickFetchHandle = takeLatestWarp(fetchAndSetData)

// Wrap the higher-order function to hold the cancel function for each time.
function takeLatestWarp (fetchGenerator) {
  // Save the cancel function
  let lastCancel
  return async function (...args) {
    // If there is a cancel function, cancel the interrupt first
    if (lastCancel) {
      lastCancel()
    }
    // Execute the generator function and assign a new cancel function.
    const { cancel, doFetch } = generatorCtrl(fetchGenerator, ...args)
    lastCancel = cancel
    doFetch()
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- Modify the button click event -->
<button
  ...
  @click="clickFetchHandle(index)"
  >
  ...
</button
```

Any subsequent code elsewhere will simply call the `takeLatestWarp` function to wrap it so that each time the button is clicked, the last request is interrupted.

### Summary of Phase 1

Thus, in just over 30 lines of code, we're done with the race to the bottom.
In our actual project, the only change was to change `await` to `yield` in the original business code. Compared to other old programs, the amount of changes is very small.
And we write code ideas, writing method is the same as the original. It's very convenient. You don't need to learn a new set of api's like Rxjs, and use Rxjs to write code.
At this point we can find that Generator is actually very powerful! We often use Async/await is not a strengthened version of Generator, but a neutered version!

If you don't want to go to the extreme, the above code is perfectly fine. Mostly, it's a very small amount of changes to the original code.

In the next chapter, we'll look at how to go a little more extreme, which is to utilize `about()` to interrupt the request and save the user's bandwidth.

The second phase is an upgraded version of the first phase, which we will continue to cover in the next article.

# Stage 2: Using `about()` to interrupt requests

#### 1. Wrapping the fetch function to support interrupting requests

First we need to wrap the fetch function so that it supports the `about()` method.

```js
// Rewrap the fetch function to encapsulate the about() stop request.
function fetchWithCancel(input, init = {}) {
  const ac = new AbortController();
  const { signal } = ac;
  const fetch2 = fetch(input, {
    signal,
    ...init,
  })
  // fetch2 is a Promise instance and an object to which we can add a cancel method.
  // The purpose of adding an object here, rather than returning a separate cancel function, is also to be able to other places where fetch is requested. You can write code that uses fetch in the same way as before. You don't have to care if you need to cancel the request or not.
  // The downside is that we're contaminating the properties of the object, which outweighs the drawbacks here, considering that no one is usually manipulating the properties on a Promise. Makes it easier for us to follow.
  fetch2.cancel = () => {
    ac.abort()
  }
  return fetch2
}
```

#### 2. Modify the interface function so that the controller can get the Promise instance carrying the cancel method

Again, we need to modify the interface function a bit to use the new fetch function. And instead of await, we'll use yield.

```js
// In order to be able to interrupt the request, we need to be able to get the executing Promise instance and the corresponding cancel method in the external controller. So instead of await, we use yield.
// So the right value of yield is a Promise instance with a cancel method, which we can get at the external controller and execute the cancel method.
function * fetchDelayTime({ data, time }) {
  let res = yield fetchWithCancel(`/api/delayTime?data=${data}&time=${time * 1000}`, {
    cache: "no-store",
  })
  res = yield res.json()
  res = res.data
  return res
}
```

#### 3. Modify the business logic function `fetchAndSetData` to delegate the internal Generator to the external controller.

Change `yield` where the right value is the generator function to `yield*`, so that we can always delegate the execution of all generators to our external controller.

> `yield*` expression is used to delegate to another generator or iterable.

```js
function * fetchAndSetData(val) {
  const args = queryList[val]
  beforeData.value = yield* fetchDelayTime({ data: args.data + 'b', time: args.time / 2 })
  resData.value = yield* fetchDelayTime(args);
  return res
}
```

#### 4. Modify the controller generatorCtrl to be able to execute the cancel function of Promise when appropriate.

Execute Promise's cancel function at the appropriate time.
```js
async function generatorCtrl(fetch)
async function generatorCtrl(fetchGenerator, ...args) {
  const fetchIterator = fetchGenerator(...args)
  let isCancel = false
  // Save the cancel function under the current Promise
  let cancelFun
  let lastNext
  function cancel() {
    isCancel = true
    // Execute the cancel function under the current Promise.
    cancelFun?.()
  }
  async function doFetch() {
    while(true) {
      if (isCancel) {
        fetchIterator.return('cancel')
      }
      const { value, done } = fetchIterator.next(lastNext)
      try {
        if (value instanceof Promise) {
          if (typeof value.cancel === 'function') {
            // 保存当前的Promise下的取消函数
            cancelFun = value.cancel
          }
          lastNext = await value
        } else {
          lastNext = value
        }
      } catch (err) {
        if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
          fetchIterator.return('cancel')
        } else {
          fetchIterator.throw(err)
        }
      }
      if (done) break
    }
    return lastNext
  }
  return {
    doFetch,
    cancel
  }
}
```

This is basically done at this point. When a quick click is made. In the console, we can see that it will interrupt the previous request.

Also, if we want to handle asynchronous operations that are a little more complex, we'll need to handle static functions like Promise.all a little while longer.

#### 5. For Promise concurrent operations, we need to deal with static functions on the Promise.

For concurrent Promise operations, you need to handle static functions on the Promise. For example, Promise.all needs to have a cancel method on the Promise instance returned by Promise.all to cancel all Promise instances in the array.

```js
['all', 'allSettled', 'any', 'race'].forEach(i => {
  if (Promise[i]) {
    Promise[i] = function (...args) {
      const resPromise = Promise[i](...args)
      resPromise.cancel = (reason) => {
        args.forEach(i => i.cancel?.(reason))
      }
      return resPromise
    }
  }
})
```

This way we can also break all Promise instances when we use Promise.all.

#### 6. Handling of axios when using axios.

We use axios a lot in our projects, so let's look at how to modify axios.
Since the `axios.get`, `axios.post` methods all call `axios.request`, we only need to modify `axios.request` here.
Of course, you can also encapsulate it in other ways.

```js
import originAxios from 'axios'

const Axios = originAxios.

const oldRequest = Axios.prototype.request
// Rewrite request to add the cancel method to the returned Promise instance. As with fetch above, this makes it easier for us to interrupt later on
Axios.prototype.request = function (config) {
  const ac = new AbortController()
  const promise = oldRequest.call(this, {
    signal: ac.signal,
    ...config
  })
  promise.cancel = () => {
    ac.abort()
  }
  return promise
}
const axios = originAxios.create()

// Interface function
function * fetchDelayTime({ data, time }) {
  let res = yield axiosGetWithCancel(`/api/delayTime?data=${data}&time=${time * 1000}`)
  res = res.data.data
  return res
}

function axiosGetWithCancel(input, init = {}) {
  return axios.get(input)
}
```

### Phase two wrap-up

This completes the second phase of our transformation. The usage is the same as in the first phase. We haven't modified the higher-order functions for the click event and the watch callback.
As you can see, the main flow isn't much different from the previous phase, but we've taken the tricky step of adding a cancel method to the requesting Promise instance to be able to do an `about()` interrupt.
This way it doesn't matter if we're writing code elsewhere, or using async/await as before. It's a very small memory overhead, which is negligible given that the page doesn't have a lot of concurrent requests, and it's automatically cleaned up when the request completes.

# Notes:

We have already completed the handling of the competing issues. 2 stage looks very good, the use of the same method and 1 stage, so is not directly all directly changed to the 2 stage code on the line?

In fact, there are some additional points that must be noted. 1:

1. If you need to interrupt the request with about, the Promise instance containing the `cancel()` method must be placed directly at the right value of `yield`. It cannot be followed by `then` processing. For example, the following code won't work.

```js
function * fetchDelayTime({ data, time }) {
  // Here we use the fetch function with the cancel method, which is on the instance of the promise returned by fetchWithCancel.
  let res = yield fetchWithCancel(`/api/delayTime?data=${data}&time=${time * 1000}`, {
    cache: "no-store"
  })
  // Executing .then here is fine according to the previous logic, but it returns a new instance of the Promise, // causing the right value of this yield to stop being used. 
  // so that the right value of this yield is no longer the Promise instance containing the cancel method, but a new Promise instance.
  // This results in our controller getting the wrong instance of the Promise, without the cancel method. The request cannot be stopped. It's still interrupted in the same way as option 1!
  .then(res => res.json())
  res = res.data
  return res
}
```
Similarly, when adding the cancel method encapsulation to axios, we do the same thing. In order to ensure compatibility with the normal use of axios, yield is generally not written directly in the place closest to the axios request function, so as not to affect the normal use of other places. This will need to be in the business code to ensure that the right value of the field written in the business code, is a Promise instance containing the cancel method.
If you're wrapping axios that will handle the then of the Promise, then you need to make sure when wrapping that the Promise instance returned after the then, is also the Promise instance that contains the cancel method.
If you have to add `then`, you need to manually take the Promise instance that contains the cancel method, and then add this method to the Promise returned by `then`.

2. Do not use `AsyncGeneratorFunction`.
That is, don't use the following syntax:

```js
async function * fetchDelayTime({ data, time }) {
  let res = yield fetchWithCancel(`/api/delayTime?data=${data}&time=${time * 1000}`, {
    cache: "no-store"
  })
  // This uses await, which is theoretically fine. If we manipulate the iterator manually, we can do it normally.
  // But we're using yield* when we nest the Generator. yield* doesn't handle the AsyncGeneratorFunction, which will probably be supported by the es standard in the future.
  // So it's recommended that we uniformly switch to yield.
  res = await res.json()
  res = res.data
  return res
}
```

3. In the controller we execute `return()`, `throw()` which does not necessarily stop the business function completely.

If the business function has a `try.... .catch` statement, then `throw()` only breaks the code in the `try` statement, not the code outside of the `catch` and `try...catch` statements. .catch` statement.
If there is a `try.... .finally` statement, then `return()` breaks the code in the `try` statement, and the code in the `finally` statement continues to execute.


4. Nested Generators need to be handled with `yield*`.
Don't take liberties with `fo.... .of` to handle generators internally without authorization, which is not equivalent to `yield*`! If you're doing this on purpose, forget it.
We just need to delegate the current generator outwards. Otherwise, we can't do normal interrupts.
The right value of `yield*` needs to be a generator, and the value that comes out of the `return` at the end of the execution of that generator is automatically assigned to the left value of `yield*`. This is not controlled by `next()`.
`next()` only controls the assignment of the left value of the current `yield` keyword, whether it's a direct generator or a delegated generator.

5. Although some of the wrappers above return the asynchronous result of `doFetch()`, this value is not necessarily the same as the value you want to return. But that value is not necessarily what you want! There are several scenarios:
  a. The business code is not interrupted, and the return is exactly what you want. b. The business code canceled.
  b. The business code cancel interrupts, but there is no finally statement, so the value of return is 'cancel', which is the value we return in the controller. c. The business code cancel interrupts, but there is no finally statement, so the value of return is 'cancel'.
  c. If the business code cancel interrupts, but there is a finally statement, then the value of return is the value in the finally statement. d. If an error is reported, then the value of return is the value in the final statement.
  d. If an error is reported, then the value of return is the value in the catch statement.
  So it's best not to use the return value of `doFetch()`, or you have a way to determine it.

### typescript
1. Typescript usage
The business function was returning a Promise, but now it's returning a Generator, so you need to change the type.
```ts
// Originally
function fetchSomething(): Promise<TReturn>
// Now
function fetchSomething(): Generator<any, TReturn, any>
```


# Use in react

If your business code used to be mostly in redux, useReducer, or something like that outside of the render function, then you can just handle it with closures like above. We won't go into details here.
If the main code is in the hooks, because react rendering will re-declare the function, you can not directly use the above way. You can wrap custom hooks to handle it.

#### 1. Customize `useEffect` to listen for state changes.

```js
export function useEffectTakeLast(fetchGenerator, dep) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const { cancel, doFetch } = generatorCtrl(fetchGenerator, val)
    doFetch()
    // Execute the cleanup function after a state change, which will interrupt the last request.
    return cancel
  }, dep)
}
```

#### 2. Customize `useCallback` for click events.


```js

import {useRef, useCallback} from 'react'

export default function useCallBackTakeLast(fetchGenerator, dep) {
  // Cache the cancel function and cancel it the next time it's executed.
  const lastCancel = useRef()
  return useCallback(function (... .args) {
    // If there is a cancel function, cancel the interrupt first
    if (lastCancel.current) {
      lastCancel.current()
    }
    // Execute the generator function and assign a new cancel function.
    const { cancel, doFetch } = generatorCtrl(fetchGenerator, . .args)
    lastCancel.current = cancel
    doFetch()
  }, dep)
}
```

# Other
The above adds the cancel method to fetch. For other asynchronous operations we can do the same
e.g. timer
```js
function delayTime(ms) {
  const ac = new AbortController()
  const { signal } = ac
  let timer
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    timer = setTimeout(resolve, ms)
    signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
      clearTimeout(timer)
      reject(new DOMException(signal?.reason || 'user aborted', 'AbortError'))
    })
  })
  promise.cancel = (reason) => {
    ac.abort()
    promise.__ABORT_REASON__ = reason
  }
  return promise
}
```

Here's a look at the similar use case code above.

I've organized some of the functions and uploaded them to npm as well. You can install and use them directly.
